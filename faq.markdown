#### What do I need to run photocontrol?

You need a device on which iPhone OS in version 3.1 at least can run. These devices are:

* iPhone / iPhone 3G / iPhone 3GS
* iPod Touch (1st, 2nd and 3rd Generation)

For the server application you need an Macintosh computer with wireless lan. This Macintosh computer needs at least Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

#### What is the difference between the synchron presentation mode and the asynchron presentation mode?

When you are using the synchron presentation mode, on every picture change the displayed output picture on the server is also changed. When using the asynchron presentation mode, the picture on the server is only changed when the picture on the client is explicitly selected via a double tap on the picture.

#### Are there any plans to support other operating systems than OS X in the future?

No, there are no plans to port the server application to other operating systems.

#### How does the client software on the iPhone / iPod Touch communicate with the server?

The client and server are communicating together over wireless lan. The client detects that the server application is running via [bonjour technology][apple]. The client also needs to be in same network as the Macintosh which runs the server application.
