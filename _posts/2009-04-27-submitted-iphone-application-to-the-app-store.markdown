title: "Submitted iPhone Application to the App-Store"

Just submitted the photocontrol Application for the iPhone and the iPod Touch to the App-Store. Hopefully it will get approved at the first try. Wish me luck!

In the meanwhile you can try the server application, which can be found in the [downloads section][downloads] ! But you will not have a lot fun with it without the client application on your iPhone or iPod Touch...
